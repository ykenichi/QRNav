# QR Navigation

Mentors: Zhigang Zhu, Feng Hu

Members: Lhakpa Lama, William Gao, Kenichi Yamamoto

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to design an Android phone application that will be able to scan QR Codes in real-time in order to help individuals with ASD navigate indoor environments. These QR Codes will be linked to a floorplan of the environment and will act as checkpoints that can update the user with their current location.
